## 🎯 About

Hello, I'm glad to see you're interested in contributing to this project.

Some settings you may have already seen in the README.md file, but it doesn't hurt to repeat them here.

**TL;DR:** In a simple and *generic* way, you can contribute in this way below:

- Fork this repository;
- Create a branch with your feature: git checkout -b my-feature;
- Commit your changes: git commit -m 'feat: My new feature';
- Push your branch: git push origin my-feature.
- Make a pull request, describing the changes you made and await approval.
- You can also make suggestions by opening an issue, reporting bugs or requesting new features.

## 🏆 Important details

Details make all the difference. Especially for attentive souls. For people who seek excellence. I will not treat this project differently.

I ask you to follow the following steps:
